/**
Design a set of types that represent the items that can be borrowed at a library. 
This library offers books, CDs, DVDs and Blue-ray discs, and some titles can be downloaded into a file as 
eBooks, audio or video files. 
All kinds of items share a title and an ISBN. Books have an author and contain several pages, whereas CDs, 
DVDs and Blue-ray discs can hold multiple tracks of audio or video each having a separate title and artist 
as well as a duration. 
Your task is to design a set of types that can be used to retrieve the information mentioned above 
representing these various kinds of items. Please use constructs such as inheritance, interfaces, and 
virtual functions as you deem appropriate and focus on public members defining the accessible surface 
of each type. You do not need to actually code the implementation of any methods and you also do not 
need to deal with the different file formats for downloading. Diagrams are appreciated.
